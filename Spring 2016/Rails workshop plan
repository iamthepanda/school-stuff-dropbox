Ruby on Rails workshop plan

how long will this workshop be?
	if it was like the last one, it should be about 1.5 hours.

I will split the workshop into two portions: 
	1. powerpoint to introduce Rails and give an overview.
	2. interactive portion to allow attendees to work on a small rails project.

This structure is similar to Khanh's git workshop. I feel like the structure worked well, so I will incorporate it into the Rails workshop.

information (.5 hours)
	powerpoint presentation. i have to figure out how many slides to put into this thing to take up half an hour of time.

interactive (1 hour)
	group code. the end goal is to have something that people can show off to their friends.

end product
	something fun that people will be able to come out of the workshop with
