1.3 network core

home access networks eg dsl, cable

cable modem is connected to cable head end 

frequency division multiplexing

physical media

guided
	fiber is different from cat and cable.
	backbone of internet
	connects countries and cities

unguided
	microwave, LAN, satellite

network core is a mech of interconnected routers
two ways:
	packet switching- hosts break application-layer messages into packets
		store and forward. router cannot forward a packet until recieving the full packet.
		ignore propagation delay
		end-to-end delay
			(N*L)/R
		if immediate, L/R

	circuit switching
		FDM	frequency
		TDM	time

IP address. destination is in packet header
every packet switch on one table
when packet switch recieves packet, will search table for entry for appropriate outgoing link and move packet for further transmission

algorithms and protocols will set up routing table
network core. two key componente are routing and forwarding





1.4 delay, loss, throughput in networks

four sources of nodal packet delay
	d_proc		nodal preprocessing
		check bit errors
		determine output link
		typically less than a msec
	d_queue		queuing
		time waiting at output link for transmission
		depends of congestion level of router

		L: packet length (bits)
		R: link bandwidth (bps)
		a: average packet arrival rate

		(L*a)/R
			~ 	0		avg queue delay	small
			-> 	1						large
			>	1		more 'work' arriving. packet loss
	
	d_trans		transmission
		L/R

		time it takes for last bit to enter link

	d_prop		propagation
		d: length of physical link
		s: propagation speed in medium (~2x10^8 m/s)
		d/s

		time it takes for first bit to reach receiver

	the sum of these delays gives the total nodal delay

	transmission vs propagation
	link length 		1000km
	link rate 			1Mbps
	packet size 		100Bytes
	propagation speed 	2.8x10^8 m/s

	L/R
		100Bytes / 1Mbps
		100*8 bits / 10^6
		0.8 ms
	d/s
		1000km / 2.8x10^8 m/s
		1000x10^3m / 2.8x10^8 m/s
		3.57 ms


	packet loss
		lost packet may be retransmitted by prev node, source end sys, or not at all
	
	queuing and loss


	throughput
		rate (bits/time unit) at which bits transferred btw sender/receiver
			instantaneous
			average

		R_s server R_c client
		end-to-end throughput is the smallest size, the bottleneck link
		R_s < R_c		R_s
		R_s > R_c		R_c

		
		per-connection e2e throughput, min(R_c, R_s, R/10)
		R_c or R_s if often the bottleneck

Lecture 4

browser connects to web server.. http protocol

if the web client wants to connect to remote server, first client has to know the server's ip address.

two types of identifiers: host name and ip address

in order to connect browser/web client, first find host name, then DNS. http invokes DNS client on client machine.

how does dns client get the translation from dns?
	dns client sends query to local server. browser is configured to direct queries to local server.

	if local server has stored... immediately..




DNS -

DNS client - sends request to local dns server

local dns server - receives request from dns client. contacts root server. contacts tld server (.edu). contacts another server

root server -

TLD server -

chapter 3: transport layer
goals
understand principles behind transport layer services...

logical communication -

segment -

transport layer - log comm btw processes.

transport layer protocols - tcp and udp. extend network layer delivery system btw two end systems. need multiplexting

network layer - log comm btw hosts

tcp - implements also reliable data transer, congestion control, flow control

udp - only implements multiplex and error correction

multiplexing -

each process is associated with a socket

unique..

transport layer segment must contain info which can be used by transport layer. so transport layer can...

need two things for multi/demulti
	there may be multiple processes in same host. each socket mucst have unique identifier

	then transport layer receives a segment, there must be a way to... appropriate

2 pieces of information used to identify application process.
	ip address of host and port number

udp

example, connectionless demux
	2 clients, 1 server

	client sends source port and dest port
	server responds with corresponding ports

tcp is a 4-tuple

udp is lightweight and simple. less delay and overhead
